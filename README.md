# USACO Problems
Some of the USACO problems I've attempted (in C++).
They are split into 4 categories:
- Competition problems
- Practice problems
- Problems from the Starleague Gold class
- Problems from Programming Club

### [usaco.bat](usaco)
A shell script to generate all the necessary files for a USACO problem in the proper folder.
(requires python installed)
